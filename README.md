# GoTiny Slack Bot

The GoTiny Slack Bot is an example of easy integration with GoTiny through the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-sdk). After adding the Bot to a Slack channel, GoTiny is available as a message shortcut. After using the shortcut, the message is sent to the [GoTiny API](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-api), which filters out the URL and immediately returns it as a short link by the Bot in the same channel.

#### Built With

- [Bolt](https://slack.dev/bolt-js)
- [GoTiny](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gotiny)

Creating short links with GoTiny is accessible for everyone at [gotiny.cc](https://gotiny.cc) and for developers there's an [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-sdk) which is free and doesn't require authentication.
